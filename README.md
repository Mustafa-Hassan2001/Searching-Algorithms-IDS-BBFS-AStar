# Searching Algorithms: IDS, BBFS and A*
Artificial Intelligence Course 1st Project: Implementing searching algorithms like IDS, BBFS and A* from scratch in order to find optimal path.
<br>
In this group project we ([pouyanhessabi](https://github.com/pouyanhessabi) and [omidmahyar](https://github.com/omidmahyar)) implemented `IDS`, `BBFS` 
and `A*` algorithms to find optimal path. In this program a robot should push a piece of butter to it's plate and the robot should do this optimally with no extra moves.
<br>

Run `main.py` and then you can choose which algorithm to use in input as follows:
